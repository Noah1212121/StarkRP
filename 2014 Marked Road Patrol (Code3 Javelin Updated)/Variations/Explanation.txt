To introduce realistic oxidation of the Code3 Javelin's Glass, I have included editable textures.

Oxidation comes from the plastic/plexi cover sitting in daylight for so long, the material becomes less clear and more foggy and becomes a greyish-yellow color. Feel free to edit the textures and replace them in the police.ytd.

Instructions:
Edit your Javglass-Oxidized.png and when finished rename it to "javglass.png" and then import into "police.ytd."

u done boo, good job keep it up
